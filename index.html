                    <h1>Copa America 2021</h1>
                    <p>Copa America 2021 is over, and Argentina is the queen of South America after 28 years, with Messi
                        finally winning his first international title. It was a long journey with 4 group matches and
                        three knock-out matches.After rejecting the
                        invitation from CONMEBOL, Qatar and Australia forced the competition to be formed of two groups
                        of 5 teams each. Argentina win the Copa America title for the first time since 1993 as they beat
                        Brazil 1-0 in the final at the historic Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro. Angel Di Maria
                        scored the only goal of the match in the 22nd minute. This is Lionel Messi's first major trophy
                        with the Argentina senior team.</p>
